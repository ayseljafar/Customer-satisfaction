## Cusomer Satisfaction | Sentiment Analysis
#In this project, we harnessed web scraping tools like Beautiful Soup to compile a diverse dataset of Trustpilot reviews, encompassing both metadata and textual content. Our analysis began with rigorous data cleaning, including addressing missing values and employing text cleaning techniques, ensuring a robust dataset for subsequent exploration. Through the implementation of diverse machine learning models, such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and a Neural Network, we achieved impressive sentiment classification accuracy of up to 94% on the test dataset. The project also delved into model interpretation, leveraging feature importance and SHAP analysis to gain insights into the factors shaping predictions, whether derived from metadata or textual data.

#In addition to sentiment classification, our project incorporated advanced NLP and text mining techniques to unveil deeper insights within Trustpilot reviews. We applied tokenization to break down textual content into meaningful units, allowing for more granular analysis. The vectorization process was employed to convert these tokens into numerical representations, facilitating the utilization of machine learning algorithms. Moreover, we integrated a Word2Vec model into our text mining strategy, enabling a nuanced understanding of semantic relationships between words in the reviews. This approach not only enhanced the accuracy of our sentiment classification models but also played a pivotal role in our cluster analysis. By employing unsupervised learning algorithm, K-means clustering, we identified patterns and common themes in the reviews, providing a more comprehensive view of customer sentiments. The combination of clustering with K-means and sophisticated text mining techniques added depth to our analysis, contributing to a more nuanced interpretation of Trustpilot reviews and offering valuable insights for businesses seeking to improve customer satisfaction and engagement.In this project, we harnessed web scraping tools like Beautiful Soup to compile a diverse dataset of Trustpilot reviews, encompassing both metadata and textual content.
